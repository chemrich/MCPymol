and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- `print_ribbon_view` tool — a 3D-print preset that pairs chunky β-strand arrows (and a fat helix) with a continuous backbone "spine" object (`<obj>_spine`, PyMOL `cartoon tube`). Because the tube ignores secondary structure, it runs unbroken through every strand→loop junction; exported together with the chunky cartoon via `print_export(method="voxel", voxel_pitch=0.2)` the voxel step fuses them into one watertight solid with no junction discontinuity, and the spine doubles as internal rebar for print rigidity. Configurable `spine_radius`.

## [1.1.1] - 2026-05-15

### Fixed
- **Bridge framing.** Both the in-PyMOL plugin and the external bridge now drain TCP responses to EOF (with incremental JSON parsing as a fallback for mock-style peers), instead of truncating at the first 8 KB chunk. Long PyMOL responses — `get_fastastr` on multi-hundred-residue chains, `get_chains` on large assemblies, error tracebacks — no longer corrupt the JSON.
- **`util.*` tool dispatch.** The plugin previously checked `hasattr(cmd, action)` for every action, so dotted names like `util.cbc` / `util.cbaw` / `util.chainbow` silently failed even though the tools were registered. Plugin now resolves dotted names through `pymol.util` (and falls back to a general attribute walk).
- **`conservation_view` residue mapping.** Previous version assumed `resi == i + 1` along the FASTA, which silently misaligned scores in structures with non-contiguous residue numbering (gaps, modified termini). Now walks the actual CA `resi` values from PyMOL and maps via a stored dict.

### Performance
- **`conservation_view`** alter loop collapsed from O(2N) socket round-trips to a single batched `cmd.do` script. For a 300-residue chain this drops from ~10 s of TCP overhead alone to one round-trip.

### Added
- `list_objects`, `list_chains(obj_name)`, `list_ligands(obj_name)` introspection tools so models can ground themselves in actual session state instead of guessing object names, chain IDs, or 3-letter ligand codes.
- `python -m mcpymol` entry point via `__main__.py`.
- GitHub Actions CI running pytest on Python 3.10–3.13.
- `print_export` tool — exports a structure as watertight, manifold STL files for multi-colour 3D printing. Per-colour-group isolation works around PyMOL's whole-scene OBJ export. Adaptive mesh repair: `auto` does a light cleanup when the export is already watertight (compact barrels like GFP — keeps the largest body, drops internal cavity shells), otherwise screened-Poisson reconstruction with a voxel-remesh fallback (robust for thin nucleic acids); all groups stay in one coordinate frame for slicer assembly. Optional `print` extra (trimesh, pymeshlab, scipy, scikit-image, networkx); degrades gracefully with an install hint when the libraries are absent.

### Changed
- Tool descriptions for `show`, `hide`, `color`, `select`, `remove`, `distance`, `execute_pymol_command` now enumerate valid argument vocabularies (representation names, color names) and include a brief PyMOL selection-syntax primer. Stronger guardrail on `execute_pymol_command` so models reach for it less.
- `pyproject.toml` enriched with authors, urls, classifiers, keywords, and a `[tool.pytest.ini_options]` block so `pytest` Just Works from the repo root.
- `.gitignore` extended to cover `venv/`, `refresh/`, `.vscode/`, `build/`, `dist/`.
- README rewritten: fixed duplicate "Option C", fixed `yourusername/MCPymol` placeholder, added missing views (`bfactor_view`, `textbook_view`, `cinematic_view`, `pointillist_view`, `conservation_view`), added a how-it-talks architecture diagram, a troubleshooting table, and a "Try it" prompt list.
- New `CONTRIBUTING.md`.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-03-31

### Added
- `conservation_view` tool — evolutionary conservation visualization using Shannon entropy
- MMseqs2 integration via ColabFold public API (configurable for local servers via `MCPYMOL_MMSEQS_URL` env var)

- A3M parser with insertion-stripping for clean MSA alignment
- Per-residue Shannon entropy calculation normalized to [0, 1]
- 18 new tests covering A3M parsing, entropy math, API mocking, and end-to-end conservation_view

## [1.0.0] - 2026-03-30

### Added
- 50+ auto-generated PyMOL commands exposed as MCP tools (`show`, `hide`, `color`, `distance`, `get_chains`, `select`, and more)
